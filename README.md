# K-Means Clustering of Austrian Municipalities

This project applies K-means clustering to a dataset of Austrian rural municipalities to explore patterns based on socioeconomic indicators.  
  
The analysis focuses on the relationship between municipality types and variables such as:
- Percentage of service sector employment  
- Percentage of outbound commuters  
- Percentage of foreign population  
  
The code is implemented in Python using a custom K-means algorithm, based on and modified from [Dataquest's K-means walkthrough](https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/tree/master/kmeans) to fit our dataset and research context.
